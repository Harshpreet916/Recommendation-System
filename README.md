## Project Overview

This recommendation system is designed to predict user preferences and provide tailored suggestions. The application utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze user behavior and recommend relevant items.

---

## Features

* User-friendly interface to interact with the system.
* Backend powered by Flask for efficient request handling.
* Machine learning models built using scikit-learn for accurate predictions.

---

## Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Flask (Python)
* **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

---

## Architecture

Below is the architecture of the project:

1. **Frontend**:

   * Handles user input and displays recommendations.
   * HTML forms with CSS styling.

2. **Backend**:

   * Flask-based server processes user requests and interacts with the machine learning model.
   * Routes are defined for prediction and data submission.

3. **Machine Learning**:

   * scikit-learn models trained on structured datasets.
   * Algorithms include collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
